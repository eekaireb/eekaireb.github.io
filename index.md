## A little about me 
Hello! My name is Emily Ekaireb. I am a third year Computer Engineering major from Muir. I am a San Diego native so I **love** going to the beach. Some of my hobbies include: 
- Swimming
- Surfing
- Hiking
- Knitting
- And playing with [my dogs]().
I actually have two dogs, Daisy and Teddy. They are both very sweet, though Daisy does like to be somewhat **vocal** when I'm on zoom calls and Teddy is a puppy so she is just *CRAZY*. 

Touching on an earlier point, I just recently started surfing so a better way to phrase my hobby would be: 
1. Paddle out
2. Miss a billion waves 
3. Catch a wave 
4. Immediately Fall
5. Repeat

My favorite quote is: 
>If you're gonna be two-faced at least make one of them pretty.

which was said by Marilyn Monroe.



## Programming Background 
I have experience coding in C, C++, Java, Python, CSS, Assembly, and Javascript. I have also coded in Matlab before, but I'll admit that is a little more touch and go. 
The first program I ever coded was in java and it went something like this: 
```
public static void(String args[])
{
  System.out.println("Hello World!");
}
```
I have done a couple hackathons before. One of the projects I made was a Chrome Extentsion, called [WIKIgames](https://devpost.com/software/wikigames), with arcade games that work interactively with Wikepedia pages.
